# SGuard
This is an example project designed with the VHDPlus IDE. With your fingerprint you can secure an object and if somebody tries to steal it, you get a notification and the SGuard drives around the room to escape the thief.

It uses an FPGA, HX711, load cell, fingerprint reader, buzzer, RGB led, ESP8266, ultrasonic sensors and motors with encoders. 

## Software
- Download the VHDPlus IDE from VHDPlus.com and follow the instructions from Get Started.
- Clone this Project and open the SGuard.vhdpproj file with the IDE. 
- Press the run button, select your FPGA, connect the signals with the I/Os you want to connect your hardware with and click on Compile
- Press the program button and load the program on your FPGA
